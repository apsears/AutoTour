# AutoTour
Automatically calculate and plot circuits through bicycle stations throughout a city.

This notebook calculates optimal routes through several waypoints using Google Maps. You must have a Google Maps project and API token.
Store this token in a json file named `token.json`

As is, it includes figures and html files for a set of circuits around all the Houston BCycle stations in Houston, for the #TourdeBCycle

Circuits are limited to about 26 stations (1 start = endpoint + 25 waypoints).
